That sounds like a fantastic use for a Stream Deck + plugin! Since you want to keep the UI/UX simple while making it visually appealing and functional, here are some creative design ideas for your plugin:

1. Minimalist Yet Informative UI Elements

Since Stream Deck buttons have limited space, your UI should communicate VPN status at a glance.

Visual Status Indicators
• Green Shield (✔) – When connected to VPN ("protected": true).
• Red Shield (❌) – When disconnected from VPN ("protected": false).
• Animated Transition (optional) – Smoothly fade between states when status changes.

Alternative UI Concepts
• Globe Icon with a Lock – Indicates VPN is active and connected.
• Broken Lock / Open Padlock – Indicates VPN is disconnected.
• ISP Icon with a Slash (🚫) – Shows when your real ISP is exposed.

Edge Lighting (Stream Deck + Dials & Touch Bar)
• Utilize the Stream Deck +’s touch display and dials for a glowing border effect:
• Green Glow when connected
• Red Glow when disconnected
• Amber Glow when checking

2. Dynamic Location Feedback

You can leverage the API’s response to make the UI dynamic by displaying:
• Location name (City, Country)
• ISP provider name (e.g., “Hydra Communications”)
• IP Address (optional)

UI Example:

VPN Status Display Idea
Connected ✅ "London, GB" + ISP "Hydra Communications" + Green Shield
Disconnected ❌ "Your real ISP: Comcast" + Red Warning
Checking… ⏳ "Checking VPN status..."

5. Stream Deck Touch Bar Enhancements

For Stream Deck +’s touch bar, allow:
• Swipe to Refresh VPN status.
• Tap to Copy IP Address (useful for debugging).
• Long-Press to Reveal More Details (ISP, country, longitude/latitude).

6. One-Tap VPN Reconnect (If Supported)

If your API allows sending requests to reconnect, add a one-touch toggle:
• Tap button to attempt reconnection
• Hold button for manual settings

BONUS: Fun Easter Eggs
• “You’re in the Matrix” Mode – Display a green scrolling code effect when VPN is on.
• “Time Travel” Mode – If the VPN location changes drastically, show a “Time Travel Activated!” animation.

Final Thoughts

By leveraging visual indicators, haptic feedback, and dynamic data, you can create a simple yet powerful VPN status plugin for Stream Deck +.
